    description: "The Volkswagen Atlas (marketed as the Teramont in China, Russia, and the Middle East) was developed primarily for the North American market as Volkswagen's largest SUV offering, addressing the crucial three-row midsize segment that had previously been a gap in the brand's lineup. Built on Volkswagen's modular MQB platform but stretched to accommodate its substantial size, the Atlas features traditional, squared-off SUV styling with a bold rectangular grille, angular headlights, pronounced wheel arches, and an overall boxy silhouette that maximizes interior space while projecting a rugged, capable appearance. Initially available with either a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 235 horsepower or a 3.6-liter VR6 generating 276 horsepower, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and either front-wheel drive or Volkswagen's 4MOTION all-wheel drive system, the Atlas prioritizes smooth operation over sporting pretensions. The seven-passenger interior emphasizes practicality with a straightforward, horizontal dashboard design, a standard 6.5-inch or optional 8-inch (later 10.25-inch) touchscreen infotainment system, and three rows of seating with the rare capability of accommodating adults in all positionsâ€”the third row comfortably fits passengers up to 6 feet tall, a distinguishing feature in the segment. Cargo capacity is similarly generous with up to 96.8 cubic feet available with both rear rows folded. A significant expansion of the lineup occurred in 2020 with the introduction of the Atlas Cross Sport, a five-passenger variant with a more steeply raked roofline and sportier proportions but sharing the same platform and mechanical components. A facelift in 2021 brought revised front and rear styling more closely aligned with the Cross Sport, updated interior elements, and enhanced technology. The Atlas has been a critical component of Volkswagen's strategy to increase market share in North America, successfully attracting family buyers who previously wouldn't have considered the brand due to the lack of a vehicle in this popular segment, though facing strong competition from well-established rivals from both mainstream and premium manufacturers."
