    description: "The original Volkswagen Atlas (marketed as Teramont outside North America) was introduced at the LA Auto Show in November 2016 for the 2018 model year. Built on Volkswagen's MQB platform, it was developed specifically for the North American market as Volkswagen's largest SUV offering, addressing the three-row midsize segment. The original design featured a bold rectangular grille, angular headlights, squared-off SUV styling with pronounced wheel arches. Available engines included a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (EA888) producing approximately 235 horsepower and a 3.6-liter VR6 generating 276 horsepower, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and optional 4MOTION all-wheel drive. The seven-passenger interior featured a straightforward horizontal dashboard with a standard 6.5-inch or optional 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, offering Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. The Atlas distinguished itself with genuine adult-sized third-row seating, accommodating passengers up to 6 feet tall. Cargo capacity reached up to 96.8 cubic feet with all rear seats folded."

    description: "The 2021 facelift introduced at the Chicago Auto Show brought significant exterior styling updates aligned with the Atlas Cross Sport, including a new front end design, redesigned wheels, and new rear lights. The interior received a new steering wheel design while maintaining the practical horizontal dashboard layout. Technology features were enhanced with the availability of VW Digital Cockpit digital gauge cluster on higher trims. The engine lineup remained unchanged with the 2.0 TSI four-cylinder and 3.6 VR6 options both available throughout this period.

    description: "The 2024 model year refresh, revealed in February 2023, represented the most significant update to the first-generation Atlas. Exterior changes included a completely redesigned front clip and rear section with updated lighting elements and bumper designs. The interior received a heavily revised design featuring an electronic shift-by-wire gear selector, a 10.3-inch digital gauge cluster (Digital Cockpit), and a larger 12.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Perhaps most significantly, the VR6 engine was discontinued due to stricter EPA emissions standards, leaving the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder as the sole engine option. Towing capacity remained unchanged at 5,000 pounds. The Peak Edition trim was introduced as a special edition for this model year."
